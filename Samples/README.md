Here you will find some samples that demonstrate the firewall integration in several applications. You will see that we will add new samples here over time as well as answer specific users questions with code samples. 

## Sample Web applications
- The Sample Application based on the "naked" Visual Studio Template for MVC applications. This is an ideal “getting started” project as it has very little code. You can access the code when you navigate to 
 [MVC_Core_3.1 Application](https://github.com/ASP-WAF/FireWall/tree/master/Samples/MVC_Core_31_Application/MVC_Core_31_Application) folder

- The Nope shopping card sample shows how to integrate the firewall in a real application used by thousands of companies by inspecting the code in the [Nope Commerce](https://github.com/ASP-WAF/FireWall/tree/master/Samples/NopeCommerce) folder. 
- Implementing a extension method for the firewall using IP2Location web API [GEO Sample](https://github.com/ASP-WAF/FireWall/tree/master/Samples/IGeoFactory%20implementation)
